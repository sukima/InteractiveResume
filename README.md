Devin's Interactive Resume
==========================

This is a unique and fun way to display my Resume / CV to prospective employers
who have a great sense of humor and curiousity.

I love [Interactive Fiction][1] and though hey why not apply for jobs using my
own personal style. And so I descided to recreate my static resume (in PDF
form) into an interactive fiction text adventure game.

Prospective employers can explore the environment and learn all about me in a
discover as you go format.

It's obvious that the static versions are readaly available for HR departments
and quick access. But this more as a way to gain some originality and *break
out of the box* of conventional mediums that you usually use to submit a job
application.

To compile and run this with the [Inform 7] develoment suite you first have to
run the `configure` script after cloning this project to establish the correct
setting file. This was to handle situations where each operating system version
of Inform 7 handles the setting file differently and needs to be excluded from
the repository to ignore changes.
